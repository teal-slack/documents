# Proposal

1. That the Bankstown Greens use Github to store our proposals that have been passed
   by the local group including those at local group meetings as well as by quick
   decision making processes.
2. That the Bankstown Greens use Slack for member-to-member communications as well as
   for quick decision making processes.
